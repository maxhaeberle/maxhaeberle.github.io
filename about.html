<h1>About</h1>

<p>
	I am an astrophysicist, working in the
	<a href="https://www2.mpia-hd.mpg.de/homes/jpott/">JuHeart group (J&ouml;rg-Uwe Pott)</a> at the
	<a href="http://www.mpia.de" target="_blank">Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (MPIA)</a> in Heidelberg as a
	postdoctoral researcher.
	Previously, I was a fellow of the International Max Planck Research School on Astronomy and Cosmic Physics at the
	University of Heidelberg (<a href="http://www.imprs-hd.mpg.de" target="_blank">IMPRS</a>).
</p>
<p>
	I am studying novel methods for exhausting the resolution limits of current 8m-class telescopes.
	In the <a href="../research/#SOWAT">SOWAT project</a>, we analyze the benefit of applying image reconstruction
	algorithms on imaging data, obtained with partial AO correction, to reach the diffraction limit of the telescope
	and in the <a href="../research/#SPAM">SPAM project</a> we work on high-precision spectroastrometric measurements of
	broad emission line regions (BLR) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs).
	For details you may take a look at the <a href="../research">RESEARCH</a> section.
</p>
<p>
	Besides the research, I am volunteering in the public outreach activities of the
	<a href="http://www.haus-der-astronomie.de" target="_blank">House of Astronomy (HdA)</a> as an outreach fellow.
	In this position, I guide visiting groups to the HdA planetarium and the facilities at MPIA campus on mount
	K&ouml;nigstuhl. For more outreach activities, check out the <a href="#outreach">OUTREACH</a> section.
