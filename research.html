<h2 id="SPAM"> Spectroastrometry of quasar broad emission line regions</h2>
<h4>SPAM</h4>
<p>
  We study the structure and extent of the broad emission line regions (BLRs) in active galactic nuclei (AGN). This
  information is crucial for estimating the masses of central super-massive black holes (SMBHs) of galaxies.
  Traditionally, this quantity is estimated using methods such as kinematic models of galaxies, which underlies
  significant uncertainties. Another method for measuring the extent of BLRs is reverberation mapping, where one
  compares the NIR echo of the BLR gas to increases in X-ray to optical luminosity. This technique is, however,
  restricted to AGN with a spatial extent of the BLR up to a few tens of light days due to monitoring schedule
  constraints of such sources. Now, the luminosity-size relation restricts the applicability to low-luminosity AGN and
  for detectability reasons this restricts the method to targets at low redshift.

  suggest to extent BLR radius measurements to higher redshifts by applying the method of spectroastrometry to AGN.
  This technique has been used in studies of protoplanetary disks around young stellar objects and theory predicts that
  this technique is capable of directly measuring black hole masses of high-luminosity and high-redshift quasars.
  Therefore, we now study the application of this method to AGN BLRs with data obtained with the echelle spectrograph
  Gemini/GNIRS.

<h2 id="SOWAT"> Speckle Holography of dense stellar systems</h2>
<h4>SOWAT: Speckle Observations with Alleviated Turbulence</h4>
<p>
  Adaptive optics (AO) systems and image reconstruction algorithms are indispensable tools when it comes to high-resolution astrometry, especially when observations at the resolution limit of the telescope are desired.
  In this project, we analyze the potential of combining both techniques, i.e. by applying image reconstruction on AO corrected short exposures.
  For this purpose, we simulate speckle clouds with and without AO corrections in the end-to-end AO simulation tool <a href="http://frigaut.github.io/yao/index.html" target="_blank">YAO</a> (Rigaut & van Dam, 2013) and create synthetic observations, including all relevant noise contributions, using the PYTHON package <a href="https://github.com/felixbosco/vegapy" target="_blank">VEGAPy</a>.
  We reconstruct the object with the holographic imaging algorithm <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.429.1367S/abstract" target="_blank">(Schödel et al. 2012, 2013)</a> to the obtained observations and find that using (partial) AO corrections enables the use of fainter holography reference stars and/or longer integration times.
  Both extent the applicability of the speckle imaging technique, fainter reference stars enable studying fainter fields and longer integration times enable the use of slower detectors.
  The results are published in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019PASP..131d4502B/abstract">F. Bosco, J-U. Pott & R. Schödel (2019), PASP, 131, 998</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Currently we work on implementing a corresponding observing mode at the large binocular telescope (LBT, Arizona, USA),
  using the NIR imager LBT/LUCI with a new detector readout scheme.
  Furthermore, we are about to develop an integrated reduction and analysis software suite that is capable of reducing
  corresponding data and reconstructing the image with speckle holography.

<h2> High-mass star formation </h2>
<p>
  The Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) large program
  <a href="http://www2.mpia-hd.mpg.de/core/CORE/Overview.html" target="_blank">CORE</a> addresses open questions
  on the processes clump fragmentation and disk formation during formation of high-mass stars (> 8 M<sub>&#9737;</sub>).
  As part of the survey on twenty high-mass star-forming regions, I analyzed the star forming region IRAS 23033+5951 (or G110.0931-00.0641)
  for clump fragmentation, circumprotostellar rotation and molecular outflows.
</p>
<p>
  The observational data are from NOEMA in three configurations and the IRAM 30-m single-dish telescope at 220 GHz,
  probing the gas and dust emission at an angular resolution of ~0.44", corresponding to 1900 AU. In the mm continuum
  emission, we identify a protostellar cluster with at least 9 mm-sources,
  where three of them show a significantly higher luminosity above a signal-to-noise ratio of 50 in the uniform weighted images.
  Two of these are embedded in rotating structures and drive molecular outflows, traced in <sup>13</sup>CO (2&mdash;1) emission.
  The velocity profiles across the cores are similar to Keplerian but are missing the highest velocity components close to the center of rotation.
  Position-velocity diagrams suggest protostellar masses of ~ 9 and 20 M<sub>&#9737;</sub>.
</p>
<p>
  Rotation temperatures from fitting CH3CN (12<sub>k</sub>&mdash;11<sub>k</sub>) spectra are used for estimating the gas temperature
  and by that the disk stability against gravitational fragmentation, utilizing the Toomre Q parameter.
  Considering different disk inclination angles, we do not identify either candidate disk to be significantly unstable
  against an axisymmetric gravitational collapse.
  The three dominant sources cover different evolutionary stages within the same maternal gas clump.
  The rotational and outflow properties of the cores are similar to those found in low-mass star-forming regions
