<h1>Sustainability</h1>

Climate change has a strong impact on the future of planet Earth and thus on every individual. Hence I am taking part in
several activities in order to make our research, our private life, but also the local community more sustainable.
At MPIA, I am taking part in the sustainability working group, where we are evaluating the ecological impact of our
research. Within the Max Planck Society, there is the Max Planck Sustainability Network (MPSN), where I contributed to
internal articles.

Privately, I am actively working in the
